# Flask PPE Detection Project

This repository contains the Flask-based web application for detecting Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) using the YOLOv8 model. The application is designed to analyze video input and identify the presence of PPE, such as helmets, gloves, and other safety gear.

## Features

- **YOLOv8 Detection Model**: Efficient and accurate object detection.
- **10 PPE Classes**: Trained on a dataset with over 700 images.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Analyze video input for PPE compliance.
- **Data Storage**: Detection results are stored in a MySQL database.
- **Flask Web Application**: Simple web interface for uploading and analyzing video files.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- MySQL Server
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the YOLOv8 model is hosted on [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/). You can download the dataset using the link below:

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sakshi272004/Novius_PROJECT
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure MySQL:
   - Create a MySQL database.
   - Update the database credentials in `flaskapp.py`.

4. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python flaskapp.py
   ```

5. Open the application in your browser:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```
## Creating an Executable File

To distribute your project as a standalone `.exe` file, follow these steps:

1. Install PyInstaller:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. Convert the Python script to an executable:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --windowed app.py
   ```

3. The `.exe` file will be located in the `dist` folder. Share this file for easy execution without requiring Python installation.

## Usage

- Upload a video file via the web interface.
- The system will analyze the video and display detection results.
- Results, including detected PPE classes and confidence scores, will be stored in the MySQL database.

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Dataset Expansion**:
   - Include more diverse PPE images for improved detection.

2. **Model Optimization**:
   - Experiment with model compression techniques for faster inference.

3. **Real-Time Video Streaming**:
   - Add support for analyzing live video streams.

4. **Advanced Analytics**:
   - Integrate advanced analytics and visualizations for detection data.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Host the application on a docker for remote accessibility.
